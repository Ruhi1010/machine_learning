# Machine Learning

## Introduction
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. Instead of hardcoding rules, ML algorithms identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.  

In todayâ€™s world, ML powers applications such as spam filtering, recommendation systems, self-driving cars, fraud detection, voice assistants, and medical diagnosis.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning from labeled data (input-output pairs).  
- **Goal**: Predict outputs for new inputs based on learned mapping.  
- **Examples**: Predicting house prices, classifying emails as spam/not spam.  

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning from unlabeled data without explicit outcomes.  
- **Goal**: Discover hidden structures, groupings, or patterns.  
- **Examples**: Customer segmentation, market basket analysis.  

### 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- **Definition**: Learning through interaction with an environment by trial and error.  
- **Goal**: Learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards.  
- **Examples**: Self-driving cars, robotics, AlphaGo.

- **Model**: Mathematical representation that maps inputs to outputs.  
- **Training**: Process of learning patterns from data.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, MSE, RÂ², etc.  
- **Overfitting & Underfitting**: Challenges in balancing model complexity.

### 9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Type**: Unsupervised, Dimensionality Reduction.  
- **Summary**: Reduces the number of features while retaining variance by projecting data into new dimensions.  
- **Use Case**: Visualization of high-dimensional data, noise reduction.  

### 10. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- **Type**: Supervised, Ensemble.  
- **Summary**: Builds models sequentially where each new model corrects the errors of the previous one. Extremely powerful for structured/tabular data.  
- **Use Case**: Kaggle competitions, fraud detection, customer churn.  

### 11. Neural Networks
- **Type**: Supervised/Unsupervised, Deep Learning.  
- **Summary**: Composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that can learn highly complex relationships.  
- **Use Case**: Image recognition (CNNs), natural language processing (RNNs, Transformers).
